With the OSHA Heat Safety Tool, you have vital safety information available whenever and wherever you need it — right on your mobile phone.</p><p>The App allows workers and supervisors to calculate the heat index for their worksite, and, based on the heat index, displays a risk level to outdoor workers. Then, with a simple tap, you can get reminders about the protective measures that should be taken at that risk level to protect workers from heat-related illness—reminders about drinking enough fluids, scheduling rest breaks, planning for and knowing what to do in an emergency, adjusting work operations, gradually building up the workload for new workers, training on heat illness signs and symptoms, and monitoring each other for signs and symptoms of heat-related illness.<br />Stay informed and safe in the heat, check your risk level.</p><p>For more information about safety while working in the heat, see <a href=\"http://osha.gov/SLTC/heatillness/index.html\">OSHA’s heat illness webpage</a>, including new online guidance about using the heat index to protect workers.</p>",

Educational as well as entertaining, the game challenges players to keep up with the stream of data from GOES-R’s six main instruments.</p><p>Colored blocks falling into columns on a grid represent small pieces of data. To save lives and protect expensive instruments, the GOES-R weather satellite must not lose any data. Users bundle like data types together by tapping to select three or more contiguous same-colored blocks, then tap on the GOES-R satellite to store the data before the grid overflows. Data blocks fall slowly at first, but arrive faster as the game continues. Each speed-up also brings a power-up tool players can use at any time to help clear the grid. They keep the game going as long as they can and try to beat their best time.</p><p>The game builds awareness of this important technical resource that most people never hear about. The game instructions also include basic information about GOES-R and geostationary orbits, as well as links to The Space Place, the NASA Science Mission Directorate’s website for elementary school kids; and SciJinks, the website about weather and Earth science for middle-school kids jointly sponsored by NASA and NOAA.</p>",

Given the sensitivity surrounding the events of 9/11, viewer discretion is advised. The app has three features:</span></p><p><strong>Tour</strong></p><p>A seven-stop walking tour of the area around the World Trade Center, accompanied by audio and photo narration. The events of the day and its aftermath are told by first responders, rescue workers, volunteers, and those who lived and worked in Lower Manhattan on 9/11. While the walking tour takes place in Lower Manhattan, the tour content is accessible to users anywhere.</p><p><strong>Explore</strong></p><p>View images related to the events of 9/11 and their aftermath taken nearby wherever you are. Photos may be viewed in Augmented Reality-technology mode which overlays images on the camera view. All photos were contributed to the museum by survivors and witnesses through 911history.org.</p><p><strong>Timeline</strong></p><p>An interactive timeline of the day’s events and aftermath. Includes links to witness photos taken during these time blocks.</p><p>The app can operate in an offline mode for non-U.S. visitors who have disabled data roaming. In this mode, all tour content is still accessible. The app includes a map of free WiFi hotspots near the tour route for downloading “Explore” photos from the vicinity.</p><p>The app is rated 9+ due to infrequent/mild realistic violence or infrequent/mild mature/suggestive themes.</p><p>For more information on the 9/11 Memorial, please visit http://www.911memorial.org/</p>",
